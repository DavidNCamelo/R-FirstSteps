Also this is a way to centralized some contents of different courses

One of the course recources of Coursera are:
    - https://www.coursera.org/learn/jhu-getting-started-data-viz-r
    - https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/ (There aren't examples in this repo but this is a good resource to contemplate)

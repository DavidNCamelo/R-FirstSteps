# R-FirstStesp
Some first script working with R based on Data Analytics fields

Also this is a way to centralized some contents of different courses

One of the course recources of Coursera are:
- [Getting Started with Data Visualization in R](https://www.coursera.org/learn/jhu-getting-started-data-viz-r)
- [Data Analysis with R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/) (There aren't examples in this repo but this is a good resource to contemplate)
